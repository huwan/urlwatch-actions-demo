# This is an example urls.yaml file for urlwatch

# A basic URL job just needs a URL
name: "urlwatch webpage"
url: "https://thp.io/2008/urlwatch/"
# You can use a pre-supplied filter for this, here we apply two:
# the html2text filter that converts the HTML to plaintext and
# the grep filter that filters lines based on a regular expression
filter:
  - html2text
  - grep: "Current.*version"
  - strip
